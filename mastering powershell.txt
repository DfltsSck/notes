powershell feature:
  autocompletion feature like linux shell.
  autocompletion in directories.
  autocompletion in switches (-) parameter.
  can use wildcard like in linux shell.
  switches can be written shortly meaning:
    if there is -computer, -connection, -composition
      you can write '-compu' instead of computer.
  variables = '$'
    example:
      $host = 192.168.1.1
        PS: ping $host
  verb-noun = it is way powershell commands are:
    example:
      Get-Help
        Get=verb
        Help=noun
  ItemProperty ---> attributes of file.
  regedit is like a folder system in powershell.
    example:
      PS: set-location -path HKCU:   ----> HKCU is 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER' in regedit.
        PS: set-location -path software
  *PS: ` ---> back tick is similar to '/' in linux
friendly commands.
  help --> similar to man of linux. 'Get-Help' is actual command that is run.
    Get-Help Get-Service <---- this will show what does 'Get-Service' does, and show all the option that are needed.
    Get-Help *event* <--- it is basically man -k 'event' in linux.
    Help Get-EventLog -online <--- this will show what the switch need or what it does.

  more --> does same as linux does.
