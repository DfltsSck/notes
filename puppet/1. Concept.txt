# Concept
  =======
    - Configuration Management System
    - Central repo. to keep infrastructure definitions.
      - If you have 5 server; which is apache server.
      - Now if you want have same config, making every server same config into is time consuming.
      - We could be config in puppet master and push to all the 'puppet client' server.
    - SSL Communication between master and client.
      - Firstly, slave send cert to master;
      - When master approves it, then the communication start.
      - Only one time certification approval needed.
