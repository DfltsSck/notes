      Powershell: Like always.
  Converting / Installing Core to Full Gui.
    Powershell Command:
      Import Module ServerManager <-- It is not required from my experience, just a note.

    DISM:
      Dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:ServerCore-FullServer /featurename:Server-Gui-Shell /featurename:Server-Gui-Mgmt

    Powershell Command:
      Import Module ServerManager.
      Uninstall WindowsFeature Server-Gui-Mgmt-Infra, Server-Gui-Shell -Restart
        Can add '-Remove' to remove binary.

Feature on Demand 'features'
 * Remove unused binary or payload to save more space.
 * works on vhd or vhdx
 * can do this to remote computer.
  If later wanted, those payload can be get from:
   WIN file (source file):
   Online as update:
  uninstall-windowsfeature -name "name" -vhd "path of the image of vhd or vhdx" -remove <-- '-remove' is important because it deletes the binary, saves disk.

Minimal Server Interface
 * '-whatif' <- this switch will check, if some role doesn't work on it or not. 
 * Minimal Server means:
    Strip away:
     destop
     start screen
     explorer
     ie
    Still have
     server manager
     mmc + snap-ins
