#Udemy python for beginners
* All the course from udemy isn't written for notes; because after this pretty much, it is statistics and gui; and below chaper are pretty much boring to learn.
  - Chapter 10 'MatPlotLib - Charts, Plots and 3D Figures'
  - Chapter 11 'Data Analysis with Pandas'
  - Chapter 12 'Python GUI with Tkinter'
  - Chapter 13 'Our First Game Bounce'
  - Chapter 14 'Our Second Game Pong'

* I might not use this note like; forever, might google every problem I tackle. Just a note i thought would be great while learning. 'Pretty much cover all the basic of python'

Python notes and uses; probably basic stuff.
