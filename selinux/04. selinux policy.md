```
policies
--------
- targeted policy: only cares about type policy.
- targeting focus on:
  - network facing
  - boot processor
- targeted policy doesn't care anything else.

- *again targeted policy run in sanbox kind of domain of their own.

- if it is not targeted; that means it is in unconfined domain.

seinfo -aunconfined_domain_type -x
  - -a = attributes
  - -x = list all types. =       which means that list all types which have that attributes.
the concept is that locking everything from external and unlocking all the untargeted in 'home' domain.
