policies
--------
- targeted policy: only cares about type policy.
- targeting focus on:
  - network facing
  - boot processor
- targeted policy doesn't care anything else.

- *again targeted policy run in sanbox kind of domain of their own.

- if it is not targeted; that means it is in unconfined domain.

seinfo -aunconfined_domain_type -x
  - -a = attributes
  - -x = list all types. =       which means that list all types which have that attributes.
the concept is that locking everything from external and unlocking all the untargeted in 'home' domain.

# selinux allow rules. "policy rules."
--------------------------------------
* sesearch might needed to installed; try 'yum whatprovides */sesearch'
sesearch --alllow <-- display's all the allow selinux rules.
example:
  - sesearch --allow | grep httpd_content_type <--- displays all the httpd_content_type type policy which are only allowed.
```
```
selinux modules
----------------
selinux modules     <--- it's like a kernel modules; "you can load or disable the modules."
semodule -l         <--- list of all the selinux modules.

cat /etc/selinux/targeted/modules/active/README.migrated    <--- selinux_module are moved in another dir,
    - /etc/selinux/targeted/active                          <--- RHEL 7 selinux module dir.

semodule -d apache    <--- disable the selinux policy module for httpd.
semodule -l           <--- to check the semodule loaded or disabled.

compiled file of semodule is in /etc/selinux/targeted/policy/*
```

```
some-other things
-----------------
all the restorecon rules are applied from in '/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_context' <--- all the context rules.
  example:
    - cat '/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_context' | grep httpd_sys_content    <--- list all the context policy that applies of the file.
```
