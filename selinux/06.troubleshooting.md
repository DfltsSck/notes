# troubleshooting on fcontext
  ---------------------------
  - any customization required selinux supervision, <--- specially in file type and ports.
  - changing port requires the selinux supervision;
    - for example:
      - changing ssh port to something other than 22.

  -  way to check if the selinux is the problem
    - first try it; it is not working.
    - try disabling enforcing temporary.
      - setenforce (0|permissive)

  -  check the context of the file and the folder.
    - use my trick.
      man semanage-fcontext
        - go the bottom.
          - use the web command;
          - and don't forget the restorecon command.

# troubleshooting on copy and moving file on fcontext
  ---------------------------------------------------
  - 'copy' will create own context the new directory.
    - cp --preserve=context     <---- it will make sure that it will copy the context to.
    - cp -c   <--- it is the same as the above one.
  - 'move' will make sure that it is the same context.
```


```
# relabeling the entire os.
  ------------------------
  change the SELINUX=Enforcing in /etc/selinux/config.
    - then reboot.
      - it because all the fcontext info in /etc/selinux/targetd/contexts/files/file_context
    - sestatus
      - to make sure it is not in disable mode.


    - force to relabling.
      -------------------
      - touch /.autorelabel <-- it is the RHEL exam.
```

```
# log log
  -------
  - dir
    - /var/log/audit/audit.log  <--- if auditd isn't running then log will go to this file.
    - /var/log/messages      <--- auditd is running then log will go to this file
    - if both auditd and setroubleshootd is running.
      - then both file will be logged.


    - search a error in /var/log/messages
      - there is a run command.
        something like sealert -l "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" <--- this will show detail error and fixing it.

    - search AVC /var/log/audit/audit.log
```


```
# don't audit.
  ------------
    - not all denied get logged.
      - if its is harmless; it will not be logged.
    - tool to check the number.
      - seinfo.
```
