# Configuring Nginx as Reverse Proxy
```
proxy_pass  <== It forward request to proxied server

Configuration Template
----------------------
###
server {
    location /{
        proxy_pass http://192.168.0.100;    <== proxy_pass does all the work of reverse proxy
    }
}

and
===
location /app {     <== we can combine it the up code in one config.
    proxy_pass http://192.168.0.100/application;
    }

¬ Tips:
    - no equal sign '=' on value proxy_pass
```

# Configuring Nginx as Reverse Proxy with the REAL-IP
```
$remote_addr    => this variable is the real user ip; not a reverse proxy ip
$http_x_real_ip => this variable will store real ip log in the backend server

Configuring Template on Nginx Server
------------------------------------
###
server {
    location /{
        proxy_pass http://192.168.0.100;
        proxy_set_header X-REAL-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
###

Configuring Template on Backend Server
--------------------------------------
###
log_format main     <== add the "$http_x_real_ip"
###
¬ Tips:
    ¬ log_format will store the log file how it is configured.
```

# Configuring Nginx as a Reverse Proxy with multiple domain
```
$host   => Nginx reverse proxy will pass the host value from header to the backend server

Configuring Template on Nginx Server
------------------------------------
###
server {
    server_name example.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.0.100;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;    <== this line will pass to the backend with host-name from header
    }
}
