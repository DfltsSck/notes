# Access Control

# Whitelisting and Blacklisting
config
    ¬ /etc/nginx/site-available/default. or. /etc/nginx/conf.d/default
        location / {
        allow <allowing-ip>;    <-- allowing specfic ip
        deny all;               <-- denying all
        include /file/dir/file; <-- all the deny and allow in one place.
            # allow 10.0.0.1;           ¬ we can only input this will control
            # deny 10.0.0.2;                ¬ all the traffic.

# Limiting connection
## Rate-limit connection for file.
```
limit_rate 50k;
Why:
    - Limiting the speed connection to user; making sure that 1 user don't take all the bandwidth
    - It doesn't protect from multiple connection.

Example speed-limit rating:
    location / {
        root /var/www/html/downloads;   <-- file is over here;
        limit_rate 50k;                 <-- limit of 50k and doesn't care about multiple connection \
                                        ¬ meaning using a aria2c multiple connection; we can get 60*50k = 3000kb = 3mb/s
        }

Variables:
    - limit_conn_zone
    - $binary_remote_addr
    - zone=addr:10m
    - limit_rate
    - limit_conn addr 1

limit_conn_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=addr:10m;  <-- $binary_remote_addr = remote user.

        ....

location / {
        root /var/www/html/download;
        limit_rate_after 50m;       <-- this is addition; which will limit after giving full bandwidth of 50m
        limit_rate 50k;
        limit_conn addr 1;  <-- this will limit it
