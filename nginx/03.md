            server 10.0.0.1;    <-- or if we want to down the server; server 10.0.0.1 down;

# Active Health Monitoring
```

    health_check interval=10;           <-- check every 10 sec.; interval=10 <-- isn't required default it 5.
}

## Fail and Pass
location / {

    health_check interval=10 fails=3 passes=2;  <-- this will check if there is 3 fail continuos; then it will consider a down.

# Match Condition
```
Isn't there.


```

# Shared Memory for Worker Process
```
what & why
    - to keep all the log of health_check in 1 place; less double check time.

config:
    - /etc/nginx/conf.d/(?).conf

    upstream backend {
        server 10.0.0.1;
        server 10.0.0.2;
        zone backend 64k;   <-- all the server / worker will be in 1 zone with 64k shared memory
    }

    location / {
        health_check;
    }
q
to Verify:
    tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

# Health Monitoring: Active and Passive
```
Passive:
    - Only checks when the request is made.
Active:
    - Check periodically
```
# Server Weights
```
Round Robin:
    - Default
    - Disribute equally

Weight
    upstream backend {
        server 10.0.0.1;
        server 10.0.0.2 weight=3;   <-- how to load is managed.
    }
```
