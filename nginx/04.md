# Static file
```
Why / What:
    ¬ the concept is here to make sure that; file which is static shouldn't be processed multiple times.
    ¬ we keep in front-end / reverse proxy of the nginx


config
    ¬ /etc/nginx/site-available/default. or. /etc/nginx/conf.d/default
        location / {
        proxy_pass <link>;          <-- just a reverse proxy
        }
        location ~* \.(css|js) {    <-- regex/extension contain.
        root /var/www/html/assets;  <-- all the file static file are placed.
        try_files $uri $uri/;       <-- try files
    }
```
