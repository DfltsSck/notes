# Perl Fundamental

# Basic
```
#!/usr/bin/perl <-- find by which perl
use strict;     <-- use is similar to import in python
use warnings;   <-- we use strict and warning to find error;
                    and bad programming

print "Hello\n";    <-- remember ';' <-- it is need to \
                                         know the line is done
print "Hello", " ", "World\n";


example that will not work:
    print "Hello\n" <-- because it doesn't know what to do; and below is the same line
    print "Hi\n"
```

# Documentation
```
perldoc     <-- it is seperate application
example:
    perldoc -f print
```

# Stopped
```
die "Hello; stopped";
```

# Standard Error; <-- magic
```
use warnings;

warn "Hello\n";
print "Ha\n";

## Save that in file and run script.perl > /dev/null    <-- magic..
    it will print only warn; cause stdin.
```

# Scalars; fixed variable
```
variable
    - allow mostly used word
    - doesn't allow "'"
    - can't start with number or symbol

convention to follow; but not required
    - lowercase = Local variable
    - UpperCase = Global variable


---
my $x = "hi\n";
print $x

print "Hello $x";       <-- this will work.
print "Hello ${x}";     <-- this will also work
```

# Operator
```
# Incrementing 'x' being the int.
++$x    <-- for pre-increment
$x++    <-- for post-increment

# Decrementing
--$x    <-- for pre-decrement.
$x--    <-- for post-decrement


print 3+4;
    - It will print 7

print 3+4, "\n";        <-- look at the comma; to seperate from int to str.
    - It will also print 7 and add the line break
```
