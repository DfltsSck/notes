  # Investigation TCP Internals
    ===========================
      - What is TCP
        - TCP is Connection based.
          - Reliable Delievery
          - Maintain Order
          - Error Check
        - OSI Layer 4
          - Segments
          - Provides reliability by require ACK
          - Maintain Order
          - Error Check With Checksum ; it data is corrupt or misses packet; it will restart the process.
        - TCP Header Contain
          ==================
          - Source Port
          - Destination Port
          - Sequence Number
          - ACK Number
          - Flags
          - Window Size
          - Checksum
          - Option
        - Data Transfer in TCP
          =====================
          - Full Duplex 'Bi-directional'
          - Three Way Handshake
            - SYN packet send to receiver.
            - SYN Acknowledgement and send SYN_ACK packet back.
            - Sender will send it acknowledgement of acknowledgement back.
          - Connection Termination 'Closing Connection'
            ===========================================
              - Fin'finish' flag.
              - Receiver will acknowledgement and send ACK packet and Fin packet.
              - Sender receive and send acknowledgement of acknowledgement.
              - TCP is closed / Terminate.
            - Ports
              =====
                - Used to identify who is talking to whom.
                - Only one process can one a port on an IP
                  - A connection consist of:
                    - Sender IP+Port : Receiver IP+Port
             - Wireshark
               =========
                - Monitor wireshark
                - Download any file.
                  - Wireshark
                    - 1. SYN seq 0
                    - TCP
                      - Source port: Ephemeral Port 'Client connect to server'
                      - Destination port is same port as server port.
                    - ACK 
                    - And start transmission file.
                    - fin+ack packet.
                - Linux Basic Command
                  ===================
                    - ss -ltn -4 'listening opening port'
                    - netstat -an 'listening opening port'
                    - ss -t 'list active port'
                    - tc qdisc add dev xxxx root netem delay 3000ms loss 5% <--- delaying the any packet send or recieve; every 3 second.
          - Flow Control
            ============
              - Sending one ACK for every segment is slow.
              - Sliding Windows - ability to have more than one segment in transport a point in time.
                - Maintained by the receiver
                - Fully realize the bandwith with link
          - Congestion Control
            ==================
              - Reduce congestion window size.
                - The sender slows down.
          - Error Detection and Retransmission
            ================================== 
              - Unacknowledged transmission
              - Result in retransmission of the segment
              - Reduction in congestion windows size.
        - UDP
          ===
            - Send it and forget it. ----> one way communication, no ack.
            - Very fast.
            - High performance networking
            - Application handles reliable transmission
            - DNS
            - VoIP 'Practical Use'
            - dig google.com --->> dns query; uses UDP.
