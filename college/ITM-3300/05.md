Data Loss Prevention
--------------------
- DLP is an ultimate solution for preventing an organizationâ€™s information being exposed or compromised.
- It is one stop to protection and real-time monitoring system of lo and audit.

Features:
---------
- DLP has a sensor built in.
  - DLP network sensors: It know what is happening in the network. It monitors all the incoming and outgoing in the network. It monitors all the traffic from any port and any services running in the system. It can block it or add to its log file.
  - DLP storage sensors: It can sense if the new storage device is plugged in or not on the any host on the network. It can monitor the storage what have been added or copied to the system. Which they encrypt for data protection.
  - DLP agent sensors: It can sense if the user is there or not by pinging their connected devices and devices. It can ping the devices where it has been to know the location.
  
- It is best to have DLP implement on the system because if the company has an insider, it can alert the admin. It is better to have it than not having it.
- My recommendation is have one in place because it has features and can protect from information leakage and can save millions for company one day.
