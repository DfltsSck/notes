# 08. UTM 

Unified threat management (UTM): It is a combined all the network security into one.

Advantage of UTM:
-----------------
- Has a bundle of every network security appliance or application into one.
- It is cheaper than buying separate device.
- It has one central application to manage everything.

Disadvantage of UTM:
--------------------
- Not a diverse of companies (application).
- Single point of failure
- Performance can be slow.


Load-Balancing Algorithms
-------------------------

| Load-Balancing Algorithms	| Advantage  | Disadvantage  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Random allocation |Simple to implement | Can lead to overloading of one server while under-utilization of others. |
|Round-robin | Request are equally divided among available servers in an orderly fashion.   | Not enough for load balancing based on processing overhead. |
| Weighted round-robin|Takes care of the capacity of the servers in the group | Does not consider the advanced load balancing requirements such as processing times for each individual request.|


Design Element Secure:
----------------------
Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) 
- It separate network that rests outside the secure network perimeter.
- DMZ cannot enter the secure network.
- It using contain web server, email server.

Sub-netting:
------------
- Different Subnet connects to different router.
- One subnet host cannot contact with other subnet host.
- Separate it ; making it secure.

Virtual LANs (VLANs) 
--------------------
- It is hierarchy system and logically groups.
- Making it easy to manage and communicate the system.

Remote Access
--------------
- Access the system from outside the network.
- It is highly secure and easy for user. To use company resource without being there.
