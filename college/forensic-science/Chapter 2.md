# 2. The Crime Scene


Physical Evidence
-----------------
- Physical evidence: It can establish that a crime has been committed or can provide a link between a crime (perpetrator) and its victim.

Examples of Physical Evidence:
-----------------------------

| Objects        | Body Materials           | Impressions  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Weapons      | Blood | Fingerprint|
| Tools      | semen      |   Tire tracks |
| Firearms | hair      |    footprints |
|displaced furniture|tissue|palm prints|
|notes or papers|splittle|tool marks|
|bullets|urine|bulet holes|

Importance of Physical Evidence
-------------------------------
- Forensic science begins at the crime scene.
- If the investigator cannot recognize physical evidence or cannot properly preserve it for laboratory examination, no amount of sophisticated laboratory instrumentation or technical expertise can salvage the situation.

The First Steps
---------------
- First Officers to arrive at the scene is responsible for securing the crime scene.
- First priority should be given to obtaining medical assistance for individuals in need of it and to arresting the perpetrator.
- As soon as it is possible, exclude all unauthorized personnel from the scene.
- When scene is secured, the preliminary exam must begin.

Recording Methods
-----------------
- Photography, sketches, and notes are the three methods for crime-scene recording.
- Ideally all three should be employed; however, as is often the case, personnel and monetary limitations may prohibit the utilization of photography at every crime site.

Recording The Crime Scene
--------------------------
- Investigators have limited amount of time to work in untouched state crime site.
- Record should be in its original state and must not be lost.
  - Such records will not only prove useful during the subsequent investigation but are also required for presentation at trail.
- Every step of the investigation should be documented thoroughly.

The Preliminary Exam
---------------------
- A lead investigator will start the process of evaluating the area.
  - First, the boundaries of the scene must be determined.
  - Followed by the establishment of the perpetrator’s path of entry and exit.
  - The investigator then proceeds with an initial walkthrough of the scene to gain an overview of the situation and develop a strategy for the systematic examination and documentation of the entire crime scene.
- This is done before processing the crime scene for physical evidence.

The Search
-----------
- The search for physical evidence at a crime scene must be thorough and systematic.
- It is important to collect possible carriers of trace evidence, such as clothing, vacuum sweepings, and fingernail scrapings.

Item are sent to forensic laboratory
------------------------------------
1. Victim’s clothing
2. Fingernail scrapings
3. Head and pubic hairs
4. Blood (for DNA typing purposes)
6. Recovered bullets from the body
7. Hand swabs from shooting victims (for gunshot residue analysis)

Packaging
---------
- Each item must be placed in separate containers. Packaging evidence separately prevents damage through contact and prevents cross-contamination.
- The well-prepared evidence collector will arrive at a crime scene with a large assortment of packaging materials and tools ready to encounter any type of situation. 

Chain of Custody
----------------
- A list of all persons who came into possession of an item of evidence.
- This means that every person who handled or examined the evidence and where it is at all times must be accounted for.
