# 4. C.S. Reconstruction 'Bloodstain Pattern Analysis'

- Bloodstain patterns are usually found in violent crimes.
- The bloodstains left at a crime scene can be interpreted to uncover the following information:
  - The direction from which the blood originated.
  - The angle at which a blood droplet struck a surface.
  - The location or position of a victim.
  - The movement of a bleeding individual.
  - The minimum number of blows that struck the victim.
  - The approximate location of the suspect delivering blows that produced a bloodstain pattern.
  
Crime Scene Reconstruction
--------------------------
- The method used to support a likely sequence of events by the observation and evaluation of physical evidence, as well as statements made by those involved with the incident, is referred to as reconstruction.
- Crime-scene reconstruction relies on the combined efforts of medical examiners, criminalists, and law enforcement personnel to recover physical evidence and to sort out the events surrounding the occurrence of a crime.

Stain Patterns of Blood
------------------------
- The crime scene investigator must remember that the location, distribution, and appearance of bloodstains and spatters may be useful for interpreting and reconstructing the events that produced the bleeding.
- Surface texture and the stain’s shape, size, and location must be considered when determining the direction, dropping distance, and angle of impact of a bloodstain. 

Impact Bloodstain SpatterPatterns
----------------------------------

| Bloodstain Pattern | Description | Example |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Impact Spatter| Bloodstain pattern is produced when an object makes a forceful contact with a source of blood. | Bat coming in contact with the victim’s head.  |
| Forward Spatter | Blood travels in the same direction as the force caused by the spatter.  |  Shoot from front. |
| Back Spatter | Blood travels back to the source of the force. | Entrance wound produces blood that is deposited on the person creating the wound. |
