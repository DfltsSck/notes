  # Fingerprint Principles
    ----------------------
      - A reproduction of friciton skin ridges found on the palm side of the finger.
      - Study of its ridge characteristics = Minutiae
        - Principles
          ----------
           - It is invidual characteristics.
            - Characteristic that it has                            * Insert 6.1.jpg
              - Birfurcation
              - ridge endings
              - ridge dot
              - emclosure
           - It remains unchanged for the rest of life
           - All fingering are divides into three class on the asis of their genral
             - L = Loops = Must have one or more ridges entering from same side and exiting from the same side.
                          = Loops have 1 delta
               - Radial Loop = Loops opens toward pinky
               - Ulnar Loop = loop opens towards the thumb
             - A = Arches = No delta
                          = ridges entering from one side and exiting in other side.
               - Plain Arch = Looks like plain. More likely blunt.
               - Tented Arch = Look like tented. More likey spikey shape.
             - W = whorls = They have 2 or more delta.
               - Plain Whorl = Drawn 2 delta, spiral ridged
               - Central Pocket Whorls = when ridge is touched the pattern is considered a central, shape is oval
               - Double Loop Whorl = Looks like 2 star is about collide while spiral each other.
               - Accidental Whorl = -------> to be continued.
         - ACE-V
           -----
            - A four-step process to identify and individualize a finger print:
              1. Analysis
              2. Comparison: compare the questioned print at (3) levels.
              3. Identify
              4. Verification: examinerâ€™s conclusion is confirmed by a second examiner.
